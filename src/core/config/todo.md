[x] create a command in order to init a .commitcreactrc

- by default in root folder
- custom path
- with default options used

[] readme to explain :

- no need to use config file
- but use it for configuring the git rules of a project
- by default the wizard will check if this file exists in root folder and if yes, use it to override the defaults options.
- the wizard can pass an option to the command in order to use a config file from an other place or with an other name.
